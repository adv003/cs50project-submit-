#### Description:
welcome to my Movie Catalogue Static Webpage. My name is Advay Sreejith, and I am excited to share with you this project I have been working on for cs50.

The webpage is designed to display popular movie posters, ratings, and descriptions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To accomplish this, I have used the TMDB API, which stands for The Movie Database. This community-driven platform provides access to a vast library of movie information, including posters, trailers, and ratings.

When you first visit the webpage, you will see a list of popular movies. Each movie poster is displayed with its rating and brief description.

But what if you are looking for a specific movie? No worries! My website includes a search function that allows you to quickly find the movie you're looking for by sending your query through the URL to the TMDB library and fetching the required information.

Let's check out the HTML code. As you can see, it's structured with the latest standards and includes a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The header has a search bar to help you find movies, and the logo will bring you back to the homepage.

Now, let's take a look at the JavaScript that powers the website. With this code, you can search for any movie you want and display its details. The website will even display a helpful error message if it can't find what you're looking for.

Each movie card has the movie's poster, rating, and overview. The rating's color indicates its overall rating, with green being the best and red being the worst.

Overall, my goal with this Movie Catalogue Static Webpage is to provide a simple and enjoyable way to browse and learn about movies. So, feel free to check it out and explore the many great films available. Thank you for watching, and this was cs50!
